					"Helper" Function Implementation
** Description:  This is a general function for getting and validating
string input that will be used to create Book and Patron objects. The
function expects string values representing the value being collected
and the name of the type for which the data is being collected. This
function verifies that the length of the string input by the user is
at least 1 character long.  Once such a string has been input, the
function returns the validated value.
** Parameters:  This function takes two string parameters, representing
the value and the type of the value.  The function returns a validated
string value entered by the user.
