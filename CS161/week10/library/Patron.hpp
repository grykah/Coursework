** Description:  This file contains the Patron class specification. A
Patron object represents a patron who visits a library to check out,
request, or return books.  An instance of the Patron object has an ID
number, a name, a list of books they have checked out, and a fine
amount that is due to be paid to the library.There are a number of
public member functions which get and set the values mentioned above.
There are also functions which add and remove books from the patron's
list of checked out books.
