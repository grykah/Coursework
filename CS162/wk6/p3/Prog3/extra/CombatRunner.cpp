** Description: Plays a tournament battle between the two teams,

**              fight another day.  The opponent is placed into a loser
**              pile to rest in infamy.
** Parameters: none
** Pre-Conditions: there must be a total of at least 3 fighting
**                 Creatures in side1 and side2
** Post-Conditions: if Player 1's team wins, returns true; otherwise
**                  returns false
