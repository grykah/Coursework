** Description: Contains the CombatRunner class definition and
**              member declarations.  The CombatRunner class provides
**              a means to run a tournament consisting of matchups
**              between two teams of Creatures lined up in Queues.  It
**              has a means for determining a winning side and other
**              useful information after the tournament ends.
